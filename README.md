# Project Cordon

> Project Cordon is a post-apocalyptic incremental browser game with RPG element galore.

The idea was born in April, 2017 after burning countless hours by playing idler-incremental games. Addictive by their nature, such games will give you the illusion you are making progress. Totally effortless progress, as the game will play itself and your numbers (cookies, candies, romances with anime girls) will keep increasing. You check on it twice a day to see how much has been done, and it will always up your level of satisfactory. This has to be the biggest scam since Bitcoin, right?
